NAME

    Apache2::AuthzNIS - mod_perl2 NIS Group Authorization module

SYNOPSIS

        <Directory /foo/bar>
        # This is the standard authentication stuff
        AuthName "Foo Bar Authentication"
        AuthType Basic

        # The following is actually only needed when you will authenticate
        # via NIS passwd as well as authorize via NIS group.
        # Apache2::AuthenNIS is a separate module.
        PerlAuthenHandler Apache2::AuthenNIS

        # Standard require stuff, NIS users or groups, and
        # "valid-user" all work OK
        require user username1 username2 ...
        require group groupname1 groupname2 ...
        require valid-user

        PerlAuthzHandler Apache2::AuthzNIS

        </Directory>

        These directives can also be used in the <Location> directive or in
        an .htaccess file.

DESCRIPTION

    This perl module is designed to work with mod_perl, the Net::NIS module
    by Rik Haris (rik.harris@fulcrum.com.au), and the Apache2::AuthenNIS
    module. Version 0.11 of Apache::AuthzNIS was renamed and modified to use
    mod_perl2. That module was a direct adaptation of Michael Parker's
    (parker@austx.tandem.com) Apache::AuthenSmb module (which also included
    an authorization routine).

    The module calls Net::NIS::yp_match using each of the require group
    elements as keys to the the group.byname map, until a match with the
    (already authenticated) user is found.

    For completeness, the module also handles require user and require
    valid-user directives.

  Apache2::AuthenNIS vs. Apache2::AuthzNIS

    The following comments are from Apache::AuthzNIS.

    I've taken "authentication" to be meaningful only in terms of a user and
    password combination, not group membership. This means that you can use
    Apache::AuthenNIS with the require user and require valid-user
    directives. In the NIS context I consider require group to be an
    "authorization" concern. I.e., Group authorization consists of
    establishing whether the already authenticated user is a member of one
    of the indicated groups in the require group directive. This process may
    be handled by Apache::AuthzNIS.
